# Crypto Whale Watcher
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uzillion/crypto-whale-watcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uzillion/crypto-whale-watcher)

Constantly looking at the order book and depth charts of different crypto-currencies on different exchanges can be painstakingly tedious. I decided to create this app to simultaneously monitor different exchanges and currencies without being bothered by insignificant trades and orders. With this app, a person can get real time trade and volume alerts, currently on Telegram, but easily switchable with other services.

## A Note About Exchange APIs
You might notice I haven't used any of the exchanges' respective node modules in this project, and have instead gone with the raw REST APIs. This is because I did not realize these modules existed until much later into the development process. Therefore, I understand that my API calls might come with manual need for stream management. But I feel going through the documentations of these modules, then rewriting the code would cause a significant waste of time and resources until I am made to realize otherwise.

## Basic Setup
1. [Fork][] and [Clone][] the repository

2. [Create a Telegram Bot][] using BotFather, note down the authorization-token.

3. Add the bot to a group or channel, and [get its chat_id][].

4. Create a PostgreSQL database.<br>

   [Installation](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)<br>
   [Creating Database](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_create_database.htm)

5. Create a file with name ".env" in the parent directory.

6. Add the auth-token, respective chat_id(s), and database url to the ".env" file as key-value pairs in the form shown below. These key-value pairs will be exported to the environment variables.
    ```
    BOT_TOKEN=Your:<your-bot-token>
    CHAT_ID=<main-chat-id>
    TEST_CHAT_ID=<test-chat-id>
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>@localhost:5432/<db-name>
    ```   
   + On a *nix OS, steps 4 and 5 can be combined by typing the following lines in sequence in the terminal:
      ```bash
     touch .env
     echo "BOT_TOKEN=<your-bot-token>" >> .env
     echo "CHAT_ID=<main-chat-id>" >> .env
     echo "TEST_CHAT_ID=<test-chat-id>" >> .env
     echo "DATABASE_URL=$USER@localhost:5432/<db-name>" >> .env
     ```
7. Run `npm install`, and run the app via `npm start`.

**Notes**:
* A lot of the major hosting services come preinstalled with PostgreSQL or provide some plugin. Therefore the steps for creating and setting up the database may differ. For example, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) has an excellend PostgreSQL plugin which upon installation automatically adds the environment variable for the database URL.
* On your local machine, the app will be served on port 3000 of localhost.

## Customizing
The app is made to use certain limits and services that may or may not be suitable for others. Therefore it is possible to make changes and customize the app to better suit the developers requirements. Please do not send pull requests to the main repository with these changes.

### Limits
The alerts are triggered by checking the various limits for the crypto-currency. You can learn about each limit in the [wiki](https://github.com/uzillion/crypto-whale-watcher/wiki) section of this project.

Limit changes are persistent and are saved to the PostgreSQL databse on the running machine. Limits can easily be changed without affecting the repository through the browser by going to the endpoint of the running app. If you are running the app on your local machine, it'll be served on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Limits can also be changed by editing the migration file, and running `npm run db:migrate`, in which case changes will be saved on the repository level. **This method is not recommended if you plan to contribute to the main repository.**

### Alerts
The app currently uses Telegram as the medium for alerts. However, if one requires they can choose to add and/or replace it with other services like Discord. It is recommended you keep the structure of the functions the same.

The alerts are managed in [message.js](./lib/message.js).

## Contributing
I really appreciate all the help that I can get, but following a few guidelines can go a long way in a hassle-free transition of your contributions into the project.

* Forking the main repository is always the best way to contribute and keep track of changes.
* Document your code, and try to follow the code style of the the base project.
* Auth Tokens, Access Codes, etc. should be loaded from environment variables, and should not appear anywhere in the code, nor should they be uploaded to the repository in any form.
* Always try and add as much description as possible with your pull requests. The following are few questions you could answer while writing the description:
  + What were you trying to do?
  + Were you successful in doing so?
  + If yes, briefly describe what you did.
  + Else, what do you think is the problem, and what all did you try to solve the problem?
* Your pull request should at least pass the placed build tests. Always double check that your changes do not break the main project. 

In case your pull-requests are not accepted, I will make sure to add a reason.

Please feel free to post issues and feature requests to the issue tab. If you have any other questions, you can contact me via email or Telegram.
