# Contribution Guidelines
Contributions are pleasantly welcomed, but following few guideline can go a long way in a hassle free in integration of your code. 

* Forking the main repository is always the best way to contribute and keep track of changes.
* Document your code, and try to follow the code style of the the base project.
* Add adequate descriptions with your pull requests. The following are few questions you could answer while writing the description:
  + What were you trying to do, and were you successful in doing so?
  + Are there any known issues that you want to mention before the code is integrated?
* Your pull request must pass the placed build tests, unless a reasonable explanation is provided. 
* Always double check that your changes do not break the main project. 

In case your pull-requests are not accepted, I will make sure to add a reason.
