# Crypto Whale Watcher
Constantly looking at the order book and depth charts of different crypto-currencies on different exchanges can be painstakingly tedious. Hence, I decided to create this app to keep a watch over the different exchanges and currencies at the same time without being bothered by insignificant trades and orders. With this app, a person can get real time trade and volume alerts, currently on Telegram, but easily switchable with other services.

## Basic Setup
1. [Fork][] and [Clone][] the repository

2. [Create a Telegram Bot][] using BotFather, note down the authorization-token.

3. Add the bot to a group or channel, and [get its chat_id][].

4. Create a file with name ".env" in the parent directory.

5. Add the auth-token and respective chat_id(s) to the ".env" file as key-value pairs in the following way:
    ```
    BOT_TOKEN=Your:BotsAuthToken1234
    CHAT_ID=MainChatId1234
    TEST_CHAT_ID=ChatIdForTesting1234
    ```   
   + On a *nix OS, steps 4 and 5 can be combined by typing the following lines in sequence in the terminal:
      ```bash
     touch .env
     echo "BOT_TOKEN=<your-bot-token>" >> .env
     echo "CHAT_ID=<main-chat-id>" >> .env
     echo "TEST_CHAT_ID=<test-chat-id>" >> .env
     ```
6. Run `npm install`, and run the app via `npm start`.

**Note**: On your local machine, the app will be served on port 3000 of localhost.

## Customizing
The app is made to use certain limits and services that may or may not be suitable for others. Therefore it is possible to make changes and customize the app to better suit the developers requirements. Please do not send pull requests to the main repository with these changes.

### Limits
The alerts are triggered by checking the various limits for the crypto-currency. You can learn about each limit in the [wiki]() section of this project.

Limit changes are persistent and are saved to the filesystem in form of an SQLite3 databse. Limits can easily be changed without affecting the repository by running the app on your local machine, and then going to the webpage on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000); or if being hosted elsewhere, going to the endpoint provided by the hosting service.

Limits can also be changed by deleting whale-watch.db file from the db folder, editing the migration file, and running `npm run prepare`, in which case changes will be saved on the repository level. <br>
**This method is not recommended if you plan to contribute to the main repository.**

### Alerts
The app currently uses Telegram as the medium for alerts. However, if one requires they can choose to replace it with other services like Discord. It is recommended you keep the structure of the functions the same.

The alerts are managed in [message.js](./app_modules/message.js).

## Contributing
I really appreciate all the help that I can get, but following a few guidelines can go a long way in a hassle-free transition of your contributions into the project.

* Forking the main repository is always the best way to contribute and keep track of changes.
* Document your code, and try to follow the code style of the the base project.
* Always try and add as much description as possible with your pull requests. The following are few questions you could answer while writing the description:
  + What were you trying to do?
  + Were you successful in doing so?
  + If yes, briefly describe what you did.
  + Else, what do you think is the problem, and what all did you try to solve the problem?
* Always double check that your changes do not break the main project. 

Your pull requests, more likely than not, will always be accepted. But if they are not, I will make sure to add a reason.

Please feel free to post issues and feature requests to the issue tab.
